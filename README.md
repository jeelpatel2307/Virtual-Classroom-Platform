### Virtual Classroom Platform

This Java project implements a simple virtual classroom platform where students can enroll in courses and participate in online learning activities. Below is a brief overview of the implemented functionality:

### Classes:

1. **Student**: Represents a student with attributes like name and student ID. Additional methods can be added as needed.
2. **Course**: Represents a course with attributes like course ID and name. Students can be enrolled in courses, and a list of enrolled students can be retrieved.
3. **VirtualClassroom**: Represents the virtual classroom where courses are added. It provides methods to add courses and retrieve a list of courses.

### Usage:

1. Students are created and courses are added to the virtual classroom.
2. Students are enrolled in courses using the `enrollStudent` method of the Course class.
3. The VirtualClassroom class manages the list of courses and provides functionality to retrieve enrolled students for each course.
4. The `main` method in the Main class demonstrates the usage by creating students, courses, and the virtual classroom. It enrolls students in courses and displays enrolled students for each course.
